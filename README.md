### Forecast_prediction_dashboard

# Context of the project

A dashboard project made with R and hosted with shinyapps. This is a project carried out as part of my second year of engineering school. It follows a Webscrap project: it was then necessary to sort, exploit and display the data. The goal of my project was to determine the error made by predictions based on the date of prediction. For example, we can think that the error for temperature prediction for day n will be lower on day n-3 than on day n-4.
