# Forecast_prediction_dashboard
A dashboard project made with R and hosted with shinyapps. This is a project carried out as part of my second year of engineering school. It follows a Webscrap project: it was then necessary to sort, exploit and display the data. The goal of my project was to determine the error made by predictions based on the date of prediction.
